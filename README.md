## My talk on Behavioral Cloning for Self Driving Cars for the Intermountain Data Event - 2017

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the python libraries from the requirements.txt. I would suggest in a virtual environment. See here: http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/. Also, to install opencv, use this command: conda install -c menpo opencv3
3. Run "jupyter notebook" from the notebook folder
4. Open model.ipynb
